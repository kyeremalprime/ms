"""Provides classes to represent module version numbers (one class for
each style of version numbering).  There are currently two such classes
implemented: StrictVersion and LooseVersion.

Every version number class implements the following interface:
  * the 'parse' method takes a string and parses it to some internal
    representation; if the string is an invalid version number,
    'parse' raises a ValueError exception
  * the class constructor takes an optional string argument which,
    if supplied, is passed to 'parse'
  * __str__ reconstructs the string that was passed to 'parse' (or
    an equivalent string -- ie. one that will generate an equivalent
    version number instance)
  * __repr__ generates Python code to recreate the version number instance
  * __cmp__ compares the current instance with either another instance
    of the same class or a string (which will be parsed to an instance
    of the same class, thus must follow the same rules)

class StrictVersion(Version):
    """Version numbering for anal retentives and software idealists.
    Implements the standard interface for version number classes as
    described above.  A version number consists of two or three
    dot-separated numeric components, with an optional "pre-release" tag
    on the end.  The pre-release tag consists of the letter 'a' or 'b'
    followed by a number.  If the numeric components of two version
    numbers are equal, then one with a pre-release tag will always
    be deemed earlier (lesser) than one without.
    
    The following are valid version numbers (shown in the order that
    would be obtained by sorting according to the supplied cmp function):
    
        0.4       0.4.0  (these two are equivalent)
        0.4.1
        0.5a1
        0.5b3
        0.5
        0.9.6
        1.0
        1.0.4a3
        1.0.4b1
        1.0.4
    
    The following are examples of invalid version numbers:
    
        1
        2.7.2.2
        1.3.a4
        1.3pl1
        1.3c4
    
    The rationale for this version numbering system will be explained
    in the distutils documentation.
